Alpha Zero Solver for Connect Four

This is a project for my own knowledge of Deep Reinforcement Learning. Some research went into this project, and a few of the files (listed below) were taken from a Github Repo:

https://github.com/AppliedDataSciencePartners/DeepReinforcementLearning

The files taken (and only had minor changes) were:
log.py, logsetup.py, MCTS.py

Other files were inspired by this algorithm's setup, but mostly written on my own. Other sources for this project include:

Of course, credit for Alpha Zero itself stems from Google's project which is described in the PDF below (also used as a resource):
